/**
 * Centralized role resolution logic for the NU Robot Club Equipment Borrowing System.
 * 
 * Production-Ready Design:
 * 1. Attempts to query the Google Sheets database (sheet: 'users') by email.
 * 2. If the user is found in the Sheet, resolves role based on Sheets columns.
 * 3. Safe Fallback: If Google Sheets is not configured or fails, it falls back to
 *    checking the `ADMIN_EMAILS` environment variable list.
 * 4. Auto-Registration: If the user is not found in Google Sheets, and a name is provided,
 *    automatically register them in the Google Sheet, defaulting their role to "user" 
 *    (or "admin" if in the fallback ADMIN_EMAILS list).
